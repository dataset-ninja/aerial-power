**Aerial Power Infrastructure Detection Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 13831 images with 14919 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*t-bar*).

Images in the Aerial Power Infrastructure dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 41 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (1449 images), *train* (10012 images), and *valid* (2370 images).
