**Aerial Power Infrastructure Detection Dataset** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 13831 images with 14846 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tbar*).

Images in the Aerial Power Infrastructure dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 109 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *Train* (10012 images), *Test* (1449 images), and *Valid* (2370 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, University of Cyprus](https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/).
